My 13th mini-project! In this one I created a personal dashboard that will fetch posts, tasks, albums and your user profile (or rather the profile of the default dummy user).

The Posts component shows the user's fetched posts and allows them to edit or delete them as well as create new ones.  

The Tasks component shows the user's todos/tasks and their current completion status. You can delete them or mark them as complete/incomplete by clicking on the complete/incomplete badge. 

The Albums component shows the user's photo albums and renders a list of their titles. If you click on them, their photos will appear for you to browse.

Lastly, you are also able to search your posts, albums and tasks by keywords to filter them.
